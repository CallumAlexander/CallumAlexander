# Cal Alexander  

## Hi üëã, 
My name is Callum Alexander, I am a 2nd year undergraduate studying Informatics (Computer Science)
at the University of Edinburgh. I have academic interests in data science, artificial intelligence, and
software engineering.
<br><br>
I am the incoming Website & Publicity Secretary for Edinburgh University Men's
Hockey Club, the most successful university men's hockey club in Scotland, and the largest university hockey club in the United Kingdom.
<br><br>
I am also a Quality Assurance Engineer at HYPED, currently developing a testing
framework for the 16,000+ line C++ codebase.
<br><br>
When I manage to free up some time from studying and working, 
I play hockey for Edinburgh University Men's Hockey Club, read Brian Herbert, and write scripts to display a Cowsay quoting Sacha Baron Cohen.
