My name is Callum Alexander, I am an **4th year undergraduate studying Informatics (Computer Science)
at the University of Edinburgh**. I have academic interests in data science, artificial intelligence, and
software engineering, and computer security.
<br><br>
Previously I have been a **Quality Assurance Engineer at HYPED**, where I helped develop a testing
framework for the *16,000+* line C++ codebase.
<br><br>
I am currently the **Vice President** of Edinburgh University Men's Hockey Club, the *most successful* university men's hockey club in Scotland, and the *largest* university hockey club in the United Kingdom.
I help co-lead a committee of 25 members while heading various sub committees on running and developing the club.
<br>
From June 2021 to May 2022, I was the **Website & Publicity Secretary** for Edinburgh University Men's
Hockey Club.
My role ias to manage the public image of the club through our various social media channels and website.

When I manage to free up some time from studying and working:
- I play hockey for Edinburgh University Men's Hockey Club
- I read Brian Herbert, Brandon Sanderson and other authors 
- I am an Asura Ranger found exploring on Fisher of Woe
- I am a very budget FIFA player, I am a half-decent Mario Kart Wii player with Funky Kong and nunchucks.
  
<br>
I dabble in areas of fintech, machine learning, data applications to healthcare, and computer security. I have attended several hackathons, each
of them with a different theme.
<br>
My Font is JetBrains Mono, my Theme is OneDark on everything (when I mean everything I literally mean everything). I prefer spaces to tabs.
<br>
Current Daily Driver: Windows 11, Ubuntu 22 with i3 twm virtual machine.
