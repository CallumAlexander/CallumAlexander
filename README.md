<h1> About me </h1>

From June 2022 to May 2023, I was the **Vice President** of Edinburgh University Men's Hockey Club, the *most successful* university men's hockey club in Scotland, and the *largest* university sports club in the United Kingdom.
I helped co-lead a committee of 25 members while heading various sub committees on running and developing the club.
<br>

of them with a different theme.
