My name is Callum Alexander, I am an **incoming 3rd year undergraduate studying Informatics (Computer Science)
at the University of Edinburgh**. I have academic interests in data science, artificial intelligence, and
software engineering.
<br><br>
I am the incoming **Website & Publicity Secretary for Edinburgh University Men's
Hockey Club**, the *most successful* university men's hockey club in Scotland, and the *largest* university hockey club in the United Kingdom.
My role is to manage the public image of the club through our various social media channels and website. 
<br><br>
I am also a **Quality Assurance Engineer at HYPED**, currently developing a testing
framework for the *16,000+* line C++ codebase.
<br><br>
When I manage to free up some time from studying and working, 
I play hockey for Edinburgh University Men's Hockey Club, read Brian Herbert and other authors, am an Asura Ranger found exploring on Fisher of Woe, 
am a very budget FIFA player, am a half-decent Mario Kart Wii player with Funky Kong and nunchucks, and write scripts to display a 
Cowsay quoting Sacha Baron Cohen.
<br>
My Font is JetBrains Mono, my Theme is OneDark on everything (when I mean everything I literally mean everything). I prefer spaces to tabs.

-  âš¡ Languages: Java, Python, C++, Haskell, C
